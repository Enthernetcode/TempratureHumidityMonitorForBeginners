# Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System Guide

This project provides an interactive guide for setting up a Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System using an ESP-01 module (ESP8266) and an 8-bit MCU (AVR/PIC/ARM/RISC-V). The guide includes step-by-step instructions, protocols, principles, interactive practice sections, quizzes, and example code.

## Features

- Detailed step-by-step guide for setting up the system
- Protocols and principles to ensure proper setup and operation
- Interactive practice section to reinforce learning
- Quiz section to test your knowledge
- Example code for both MCU and ESP-01 module
- Interactive user interface with colorful text for better user experience

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `colorama` library (for colored text)

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Install the `colorama` library using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install colorama
    ```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the script.
   ```bash
   git clone https/github.com/Enthernetcode/TempratureHumidityMonitorForBeginners
   ```
2. Run the script using Python:
    ```bash
    python start.py
    ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the guide, take the quiz, and practice the steps interactively.

## Components Required

- ESP-01 module (ESP8266)
- 8-bit MCU (e.g., AVR like ATmega328P, PIC like PIC16F877A, ARM like STM32F103, RISC-V like GD32VF103)
- Temperature and Humidity Sensor (e.g., DHT11, DHT22)
- Breadboard and Jumper wires
- Power supply (3.3V for ESP-01 and appropriate supply for MCU)
- USB-to-Serial adapter for programming ESP-01
- Resistors (10kÎ© for pull-up, others as needed)
- Capacitors (decoupling capacitors, if necessary)

## Interactive Guide Steps

1. **Gather Components**
2. **Set Up ESP-01 Module**
3. **Interface with 8-bit MCU**
4. **Connect Temperature and Humidity Sensor**
5. **Program the MCU**
6. **Establish Communication Between ESP-01 and MCU**
7. **Test the System**

## Protocols

1. Ensure proper power supply connections.
2. Use appropriate pull-up resistors where necessary.
3. Avoid electrostatic discharge when handling components.
4. Follow the pin configurations and datasheets strictly.

## Principles

1. Understand the functionality of each component.
2. Maintain a clean and organized workspace.
3. Double-check connections before powering the circuit.
4. Test individual components before integrating them.

## Example Code

### MCU (AVR, using Arduino IDE)
### ESP-01 (ESP8266, using Arduino IDE)

## Interactive Practice

Follow the interactive practice steps in the script and confirm each step before proceeding. Use the example code provided to program your MCU and ESP-01.

## Quiz

Test your knowledge with the quiz section in the script. Answer multiple-choice questions to assess your understanding of the system setup and operation.
